It is not a rare occurrence to struggle to get everyone to pay their share. Some people will only pay back the menu price for their item, even though tax and tip cause it to actually cost more. Sometimes, people insist on an even split of the bill, even though they purchased disproportionately more than everyone else. BillSplitter is meant to solve these problems by allowing users to just snap a picture of a receipt, and send everyone a request for the exact amount they owe based on that receipt."}),(0,i.jsx)("h2",{children:"User Insights"}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:"When we were first experimenting with our initial prototypes, we faced hurdles due to the color-scheme and initial design choices. The users who viewed our initial prototypes did not like the red and blue color scheme at all and found it visually distracting and not appealing at all. The users also did not like our original home page design, especially since the website was meant to act as a mobile application. We received feedback from numerous people who all recommended reworking the original color scheme and design elements. Because of this, we had to decide on a path forward. After discussing among ourselves and the users who criticized the previous design, we decided to choose a green color scheme as the theme to use. Because green has a subtle association with money, this would be a good fit for BillSplitter. However, we were unsure of how to use the green color-scheme. We were thinking of either a darker version with light green colors or a lighter white version with darker green colors to contrast."}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:"When finalizing the design direction to go, we ran a study with two variants of BillSplitter, a light-mode version and a dark-mode version. In the experiment, we would randomize which version was shown to the user first, so that that would not affect the results of the study. After letting the users use each of the two variants, they answer four questions. Two of the questions were on the visual appeal of each design, ranked on a 5-point Likert Scale and two questions were on the ease-of-use of each design, also ranked on a 5-point Likert scale. After gathering these results, we ran a t-test comparison and found the light-mode variant fared better in both metrics. Overall, we came out of the study with the following insights:"}),(0,i.jsxs)("ol",{children:[(0,i.jsx)("li",{children:"First, we found that the light-mode version was considerably easier to use than the dark-mode version.

These changes were made following the initial prototypes, and our experiment with users confirmed that this change was the right one to make.

We decided to include a taskbar so users can easily change between these pages when using the application. Initially we had an image and title for each of these on the taskbar so it would be intuitive for people to select which one to go to. We went for a red and blue color scheme and had the design elements change within the two colors based on what they were."}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:"This initial design faced criticism on its visual appeal, especially when it came to its color scheme. We decided to do a complete redesign of BillSplitter. First, we changed the color-scheme from red and blue to just green. This gives it a more uniform feel and green symbolizes money, which our app is used to share and transfer. We then settled on a light-mode design with green colors after performing an experiment against an alternate dark-mode design. Additionally, we reworked the taskbar to be more visually appealing. We removed the titles for each of the buttons and made it just logos. Because mobile app users are used to taskbars, we used a similar layout to most apps. We decided on the 5 icons before, but the order was set to home, then bills, then camera, then friends, then user profile/settings. The placement of the home page, camera page, and user profile page are similar to most other mobile applications, so after some experimenting it would not be difficult for users to understand what each icon meant."}),(0,i.jsx)("img",{src:"./assets/IMG_4181.png",alt:"Current design of the BillSplitter application",style:{width:"100%",marginTop:"20px"}}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{style:{fontSize:"0.9em",color:"#555"},children:(0,i.jsx)("i",{children:"Caption: Current design of the BillSplitter application on the homepage, containing a welcome message, the user\u2019s current balance, recent transactions, and the taskbar on the bottom."})}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:"These design changes proved successful, and most users found the new app design much more appealing than the previous design. The taskbar was highlighted as having improved heavily by users who tried both versions.

We started with three designs that each of us thought of. We then narrowed it down to BillSplitter based on the use cases of each design, and what we thought would be the most useful. Then, we made our first prototype. Making this first prototype was crucial to learn what to change early on when developing BillSplitter. We realized what worked and what didn\u2019t work. We were able to change the key parts that users didn\u2019t like, in particular the color-scheme and the taskbar. Being able to do this, we saw immense improvement in how BillSplitter was perceived.
